         * Comments: I actually enjoyed this homework. Lab 8 and 9 had been very helpful in understanding the concepts, 
         * and I found the instructions on the website very clear and approachable. I decided to add fun colors to mine
         * but tried to keep the idea between the sun, earth and moon.
